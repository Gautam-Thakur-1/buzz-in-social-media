# Social Media Buzz
Ranking significant features for increasing social media buzz via regression analysis.

This code was developed as a study tool for the Predictive Modeling, Model Fitting, and Regression Analysis course provided by the University of California Irvine on Coursera.
It utilizes the Buzz in Social Media data set, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository, for identifying the attributes in social media content that have the highest correlation to the amount of repercussion it gained. To achieve such result, several linear regression models are constructed, then ranked based on their respective model fit measure (R-square).
